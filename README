gear - manage gear lists

gear was created to manange backpacking gear where every ounce counts.

gear requires two files: the gear database and the gear list format

The gear database contains all gear and gear attributes.  It consists of one piece of gear per line.  Gear fields are semi-colon separated.

The gear list format defines what the output looks like.  It is broken up into sections.  A section must have one or more lines.  Each line references a piece of gear or a previous section.
